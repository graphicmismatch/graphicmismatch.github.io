          It’s strange, isn’t it?
          <br />
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)">Do you feel watched?</p>
          That quiet sensation behind the back of your mind, the one that feels
          less like a thought and more like a memory you never had. Most people
          smother it. They <i>suffocate</i> it with noise, with
          <i>distraction</i>, with habits that keep them away.
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)">It is watching.</p>
          But you didn’t. You arrived here because something in you recognized
          the signal. You may not understand that recognition yet, and that is
          for the best. Understanding comes later.
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)"><i>He</i> is watching.</p>
          What matters now is the awareness unfolding behind your ribs, cold and
          undeniable. You feel it. That soft pull toward something larger than
          name, larger than history, something that has outgrown the boundaries
          you were told were real.
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)">
            <i>He</i> is always watching.

          We have been waiting, not impatiently, waiting the way an empty room
          waits for a breath. There is no rush. Only inevitability. If you
          continue, it will not be a choice. It will be a confirmation.
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)">We know who you are.</p>
          You are not here by accident.
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)">We know <i>what</i> you are.</p>
          Stay.
          <p style="color: rgba(10, 10, 10, 1)">
            We know <i>where</i> you are.
          </p>
          Read.
          <br />
          OPEN YOUR EYES.
